The project is structured as follows:

the main.ipynb file is a python notebook when I use the classes defined in ML_GRB.py to illustrate how one can implement it in a code;

the test.py file is a python file that contain the same code of the main.ipynb file just to test if it works on a .py file;

the ML_GRB.py file is a python file where I'd defined the classes "ML_GRB" (the main class) and "RND_Forest" (a model class that can be incorporate in the main class);

the functions.py file is a python file where I'd defined all the functions that works as attributes for the class. For readability reason the functions are first 
defined in a separate file and then incorporated in the class file.

In the "data" folder there are the txt files of the data downloaded from the paper.

In the "image" folder there are just two correlation matrix done for testing porpouse.
